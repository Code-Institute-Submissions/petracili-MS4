# <a name="summary"></a> Summary

The intention of the website is to be whimsycal 

* The font family chosen is 'Segoe UI' as this has a whimsycal touch, close to a typewriter style text whilst also being clear and easy to read
* The colour scheme selected is a shade of green with a consistant cover image throughout the site.
* The cover image was selected as it shows the site is all about plants whilst also providing some clear space for text and not being too distracting as a cover image with content over the top of it

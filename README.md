# <a name="summary"></a> Summary
This site is an e-commerce store selling plants. The title of the website was inspired by problem with pollution of the planet earth. And the need to preserve the environment and thus the need for new plants due to a large number of cut forests and emissions of harmful gases.

This site provides an array of plants which can be searched, viewed by standard users, favourited by users which create a profile and added to, edited and deleted by store admin.
